# calculator
A simple javascript calculator web app

(part of "the odin project" exercise project series)

Any feedback is appreciated...
please do let me know, if you think there is an issue...
specially, if it's with the core funtionality (AKA "basic math calculations")

known bugs:
1. if no operator is choosen after "=", then it ignores current total & start from scratch
	(although it's a normal behaviour in many old calculators)

goals:
1. add new key (+/-) to enable support for negative value input
