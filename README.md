# calculator
A simple javascript calculator web app 📲

(part of "the odin project" exercises)

Any feedback is appreciated...🙏
please do let me know, if you think there is an issue!

⌨️ Keybindings (for special keys):
1. All clear/reset  => "Delete" key,
2. Negation (+/-) => "Shift" Key,
3. Backspace (delete last character) => "Backspace" key

✨ Features:
1. Physical keyboard input is supported
2. Decimal calculation are supported
3. Negation of values (+/-) is supported

🐞 known bugs:
1. if no operator is chosen after "=", then it ignores current total & start from scratch
(although it's a normal behavior in many old calculators)
2. for firefox users on desktop:<br/>
whenever user press "/" key (assigned for "÷"), firefox open "quick search" and interrupt normal usage.
